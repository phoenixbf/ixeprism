# PRISMIN

![Test Image 1](./res/prismin-header.png)

The PRISMIN (Processing and transfeR of Interaction States and Mappings through Image-based eNcoding) framework, allows to encode users' interaction states and mappings into compact and lightweight images, easily *manipulable* and *transferable* between peers in networked contexts. The framework - designed and developed by B. Fanini (CNR ISPC) - is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): it can be used to develop and deploy dedicated services targeting specific scenarios and research infrastructures.

PRISMIN offers **Interaction Prisms** (`QPrism class`) that can be used to *refract* interaction states and *bake* them into 2D images (atlases), as well as runtime accessories like **Interaction Volumes** (`QVolume class`) that can be arranged and deployed in virtual 3D scenes to capture or influence user interactions within specific areas.

The image-based approach offers GPU-friendly encoding/decoding routines and easy implementations for WebGL shaders to visualize and inspect captured data targeting networked visual/immersive analytics. Furthermore, different atlas layouts allows direct manipulation on GPU and offline processing using common 2D image algorithms to extract, combine or compare user interactions.

## Getting started
First install/update core library modules, from root folder:
```
npm install
```

Then, test out different built-in tools (see specific READMEs):
```
cd tools/<toolname>/
```
